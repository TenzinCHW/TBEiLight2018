Control system for The Butterfly Effect. This project uses Arduino Nano with nRF24L01 module.

This used to use Raspberry Pi 3 for the configuration of the lamp and drum locations.
However, since the Raspberry Pi 3 broke inside the drum due to rain or some impact,
We transferred all the functionality to the code in Drums/MasterDrum.
